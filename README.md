The project is a research study on the spread of Arboviruses in Australia's SA3 region. Since 2002, the number of infections caused by these viruses has increased in Australia. Concerns have been raised that these figures will only climb in the coming years and will pose a serious threat to public health on a global scale.

The data used for this Research remains sensitive and can not be posted to the repository for public view.

People who possess the data should be able to load it by running the following command: `read_csv(file.choose()).`

The `file.choose()` function within `read_csv()` will open a file chooser dialogue window which will allow the users to choose and read the appropriate csv dataset from their system to the code base.

To access the shiny app, open `Lifeblood-Arbivirus-app` folder > Server.R in RStudio and run the app. 

To access the presentation slides created using xaringan, open Presentation > Presentation.Rmd in RStudio and knit the file.

To access the final report, open Report > Report.Rmd and knit it using RStudio. Alternatively, you can view it in [RPubs]()

The Data folder contains the shape file of [SA3 region of Australia from 2011 Census data](https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1270.0.55.001July%202011).
