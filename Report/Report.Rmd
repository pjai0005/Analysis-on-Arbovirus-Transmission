### Statistical Analysis

We performed some statistical analysis in order to uncover underlying patterns, trends, and other significant details in the data. In order to understand the relationship between the different variables and know which variable has a significant effect on the incidence or the donation rate, we built a series of statistical models by considering different combinations of variables. Statistical analysis provides context and explanations for the otherwise vague numbers in the dataset (Ali & Bhaskar, 2016). Though visualisations are the sole purpose of this project, the results and inferences are definitive only when statistically tested and quantitatively proven. Therefore, a statistical analysis was carried out on the data set along with creating the visualisations. 


<!-- ![Figure 7: Table of mean and variance to check if it is fit to undergo Negative Binomial](images/mean.png) -->

#### Negative Binomial 

We performed a Negative Binomial Distribution, which is a discrete probability distribution for random variables (Negative Binomial & Zero-Inflated Models in R Using Microbiome Data | Nutribiomes, n.d.). The random variable is the number of iterations that result in a certain success rate. To put it another way, it is the frequency of failures prior to success (Stephanie, 2015).
 
We specifically selected negative binomial regression, a technique very close to multiple regression. There is one difference, though: in negative binomial regression, the dependent variable follows the negative binomial. The variables can therefore be positive or negative integers. These regressions are one of the most popular modelling techniques for overdispersed count outcome variables. Negative binomial regression can be used when the conditional variance is greater than the conditional mean, as is the case for over-dispersed count data  (Negative Binomial Distribution, n.d.). As seen from the table below, the variance is not so much greater but yet justifies negative binomial regression.


```{r, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/mean.png")
```


We conducted the regressions by keeping the donation rate as our predictor variable and the incidence rate as the dependent variable for all the models. In addition to several negative binomial regressions, we also used Poisson regression to see if the data contained count data, which are discrete data with non-negative integer values (Huang, 2019). Also, negative binomial regression shares many common assumptions with Poisson regression, such as linearity in model parameters, independence of individual observations, and the multiplicative effects of independent variables. 

```{r, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/aic.png")
```


Negative Binomial (Weather) and Negative Binomial (Full Data) have additional parameters like weather conditions (rainfall, temperature, and humidity) and all variables respectively as their dependent variables. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC) as a metric to evaluate the quality of our models. Low complexity and a good fit are indications of a model with a low AIC. We discovered that expanding the number of parameters improves the AIC values of negative binomial regression. As a result, we chose the basic negative binomial model (donation rate as our predictor variable and the incidence rate as the dependent variable) for further analysis.


##### Negative Binomial Summary

The table below shows the summary statistics of the full data negative binomial.

```{r, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/SummaryTable.png")
```

Because the median deviance residual is almost zero, our model is not biased in either way, which means the outcome is neither overestimated nor underestimated.

Coefficients: We have established the hypotheses H0 and H1 in order to analyse the negative binomial. H0 is the ultimate determinant (donation rate), and it is unrelated to the dependent variable, whereas H1 is related to the dependent variable. According to the p-value we have (0.996), which is higher than 0.05. The null hypothesis is not rejected since the divergence from it is not statistically significant. A valid null hypothesis is more consistent with the sample data when the P-value is higher. Furthermore, lower P-values indicate that the sample data do not support the null hypothesis. Although the coefficients are associated, they are not substantial enough to provide a sound conclusion. 

Null Deviance: It is implied by a low null deviation that the data can be adequately described by utilising the intercept alone. If the null deviation is significant, then fitting the model with more than one parameter makes sense, but for our model, it is not true.

Residual Deviance: We have a low residual deviation, which indicates our trained model is suitable.

Degree of freedom: The residual deviation should be near to the degrees of freedom for a well-fitting model, however, it is not the case in this instance.


##### Under and overfitting of data

```{r, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/over-under.png")
```

The theoretical Negative Binomial fit is represented by the red curved line. The height indicates the gap between expected and observed numbers is "hanging" from each position on the bar. A hanging bar below 0 suggests underfitting, whereas a hanging bar above 0 indicates overfitting and because the bars do not lie in just about any direction, indicating the data is a well-fitted model. 

Additionally, we used a method called zero-inflated negative binomial regression to determine if the data particularly accumulated at a zero distribution. Negative binomial regression with zero inflation is used to model count variables containing excessively many zeros, typically for overdispersed count outcome variables. Theoretically speaking, the extra zeros may be represented independently and are produced by a different process from the count values (Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Regression | R Data Analysis Examples, n.d.). When we performed Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Regression on the fundamental negative binomial model (with the incidence rate as the dependent variable and the donation rate as the predictor variable), we received all NA values as a result. Consequently, we made the decision not to pursue it further.



#### Principal Component Analysis

The other statistical analysis that we performed was a Principal Component Analysis of the blood donation data. It is a well-known unsupervised learning method for decreasing the dimensionality of data. It is one of the most extensively used techniques for a wide range of tasks, including data de-noising, information compression, and exploratory data analysis. While preventing information loss, it simultaneously improves interpretability (Principal Component Analysis in Machine Learning | Simplilearn, n.d.). Vectors make up the primary components, but they are not picked at random. The biplot that we produced (distance biplot), shown below, makes it simple to understand the key components.


```{r, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pca.png")
```

```{r, out.width = "40%"}
pca_table <- read_csv("images/pca_table.csv")

pca_table %>% datatable(escape = FALSE, 
                  caption = htmltools::tags$caption (style = 'caption-side: top; text-align: center;  
                                                              color: black; font-family: Arial; 
                                                              font-size: 120% ;', 'SA4 Regions'))
```


Instead of SA3 regions, the graph above uses SA4 regions. Despite the fact that we are solely focusing on the SA3 regions in the report, presenting all 334 codes would have been chaotic and confusing. So instead, we opted to perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on 88 SA4 regions. Also, in order to comprehend the graph better, we have a reference table containing all of the SA4 codes and the names of the SA4 regions. The graph displays all the significant factors that were utilised to estimate the incidence rate caused by arboviruses. To account for the most variation in the original characteristics, the very first principal component is calculated. After the first principal component, the second component, orthogonal to the first, explains the most variation (Wicklin, 2019). So for the first principal component, we have the donation rate and population contributing the highest, which is also found to be moving in the same direction. This is due to the fact that the donation rate is computed using the population variable. Another interesting thing to note is that temperature and incidence are highly correlated.

From the Biplot, we also found that regions like 604 and 102 (West and North West and, Central Coast) witness higher humidity while 506 and 509 ( Perth - South East, Western Australia - Wheat Belt) experience it less. Regions like 602 and 603 (Launceston and North East and South East) have a similar ratio for the blood donation rate and population. Region 205 (Latrobe - Gippsland) has a higher blood donation rate given its population size whereas 211 (Melbourne - Outer East) is bigger in population. Yet, we see a lower blood donation rate in the former region compared to the blood donation rate in the latter. Another interesting thing to note is that temperature and incidence rate are highly correlated. For rainfall, no regions had a significant association with the independent variable, donation rate. Finally, we have some regions (e.g., 308-Fitzroy and 318-Townsville) which experience higher temperatures and have a higher incidence rate than the rest. 

The correlation between temperature and incidence rate was an intriguing finding in the Principal Component Analysis, which led us to our next segment where we investigated the effects of different weather conditions with respect to the incidence rate.


### The Effects of Weather Conditions 

Considerable attention has been drawn over the past few years to the possible effects of global warming on human health. Of these infectious diseases, those most likely to be affected by global warming are diseases that are transmitted by insect vectors, especially mosquito-borne viruses. The importance of weather in the genesis of outbreaks of human arboviral disease in Australia has been widely recognised. According to Tozan et al., 2020, the transmission of such arboviral infections is highly sensitive to both climatic and non-climatic conditions. A slight change in weather patterns can cause tremendous alterations in virus transmission cycles. In particular, heavy rainfall and flooding may result in outbreaks of these viruses. Understanding the relationship between various weather conditions and virus transmission can help you be more prepared when such weather changes occur. Let us have a deeper look at each weather condition below.


#### Temperature

The whole life cycle of a vector is temperature and humidity-dependent. Hence, vector competence, which is the physiological ability of a mosquito to become infected with and its ability to transmit disease (Kain et al., 2022), is also temperature and humidity-dependent. Different species react differently to changes in temperature, though. Vector competence should increase with an increase in temperature within a certain range.  Additionally, blood-feeding, which is when insect vectors feed on animals to take their blood (also known as hematophagy), is susceptible to changes in temperature. Apart from this, mating is also massively affected by temperature. A temperature rise is supposed to make the virus move more towards the poles and to regions with higher elevations (where the temperature is low). 

Australia is a country with diverse weather patterns. Understanding the relationship between arbovirus transmission and a country with such diverse weather conditions is critical. Therefore, we decided to understand the impact of temperature on incidence rate by SA3 region and year. Since the dataset contained minimum and maximum temperatures, we obtained the average temperature by adding the minimum and maximum temperature values and dividing them by 2. Since both average temperature and incidence rate are numerical variables, we choose to find the correlation between them by building a linear model. This model was chosen because a negative or positive correlation between the two numeric variables can be easily identified. The linear model uses least squares to fit a line to the data points and the degree of correlation is Pearson’s correlation coefficient (Chambers, 2017). This correlation value ranges from -1 and + 1. If the incidence rate increases as the temperature increases then the correlation between them is said to be positive. Whereas, if the incidence rate decreases as the temperature decreases, then the 2 variables are said to have a negative relationship between them. We aim to find a negative correlation between them because according to Robert et al., (2020). As they mention that arbovirus transmission may decrease because they cannot handle warm temperatures we would like to know if it is true for Australia.  


```{r, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/temp.png")
```

Based on this graph, it can be inferred that temperature and incidence rate has a slightly positive correlation. That is the incidence rate increases as temperature increases. Therefore, the claim made by Robert et al., (2020) is true for arbovirus transmission in Australia. Next, we wanted to understand if this has anything to do with the SA3 regions. Since temperature is highly region based we wished to determine if the transmission was high in regions with higher temperatures. Since this involves a spatial variable, we used a choropleth map to see the significance of region on temperature and thereby understand the relationship between temperature and incidence rates. 


```{r, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/temp_map.png")
```

As can be noticed here, the temperature decreases gradually from the Northern to Southern Australian regions. The incidence rate is also higher for Northern regions when compared to the southern regions. 



#### Rainfall

Rainfall can have a delayed effect on the transmission of arbovirus(Lowe et al., 2018). So, determining the effects of rainfall on transmission can be very difficult since it also depends on the ecological conditions. Some vectors prefer to breed and lay eggs in containers filled with water hence increasing the vector population as mentioned by Epstein (2007). Since we are focussing on the incidence rate and rainfall, we would like to discover the dependency of the incidence rate on rainfall. Disease outbreaks usually occur after a lagged period of heavy rainfall in a region. With increased rainfall, the amount of larvae increases. However, just this increase cannot be a precursor to arboviral transmission as a larvae has to mature and go through metamorphosis before it can become a carrier of any virus (Stewart et al., 2013). However, we are not interested in understanding the lagged relationship between rainfall and incidence rate since it is out of the scope of this project. Just like with temperature, we laid out the average rainfall rate and incidence rate on a linear model. Ideally, increased rainfall should increase the incidence rate as mentioned earlier.


```{r, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rain.png")
```

This is evident from the graph above as there is a slight positive correlation between the 2 variables. Following this, we hoped to see if there was a relationship between these 2 variables and the SA3 regions. Again, we used a choropleth map to investigate this. 


```{r, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rain_map.png")
```

Coastal regions like Cassowary, Mackay, Port Doughlas, etc. have high rainfall and incidence rates. However, a very evident relationship is not observed between SA3 regions, rainfall and incidence rates. Similar to temperature, rainfall rate and incidence rate do not show any trend or seasonality over the years too.



#### Relative Humidity

As previously stated, temperature and humidity have an impact on a vector's life cycle. Numerous viruses have been demonstrated to be sensitive to the surrounding humidity, although the exact processes behind this phenomenon are still unknown. The relationship between relative humidity (RH) and viability has been thoroughly reviewed in a WHO report (Sobsey & Meschke, 2003.).  We have compared RH (the ratio of the actual water vapour pressure to the saturation vapour pressure of the surrounding air) with the incidence rate of infections. 


```{r, out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/humid.png")
```

The dataset contained the mean minimum and maximum RH by SA3 regions. Just like the other two temperature variables, we constructed a linear model graph to find correlations between the RH and the virus's incidence rate. The linear model shows a slightly negative correlation which indicates that the incidence rate increases as the relative humidity decreases, and hence the correlation between them is negative. 

```{r, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/humid_map.png")
```

According to Yang & Marr, 2012), we found that enveloped viruses, which contain a lipid membrane, survive better at lower RH, while nonenveloped ones tend to be more stable at higher RH. Since we are dealing with the genus of RNA viruses known as alphaviruses, which likely appear to have an outer membrane (Wikipedia Contributors, 2019), they can thrive better in less humid environments. The map above illustrates that Australia's coastal regions have greater humidity levels, as winds travelling from the sea to land carry a considerable amount of moisture with them. They substantially increase the humidity in coastal regions. As a result, compared to the inland of the country, viral transmission is relatively lower close to the shores. No matter the temperature of your area, research demonstrates that a space with 50% humidity may not only provide you with the comfort you want but is also proven to enable quick viral inactivation, with fewer than 1% of viruses still active after two days (How Healthy Humidity Can Help Fight Viruses and More, 2021).


### Results and Discussion

The various analysis and visualisations created helped in answering the research questions that were mentioned earlier. When comparing the imported and locally transmitted cases, Dengue is the virus with the highest number of imported cases whereas West Nile Kunjin and Japanese Encephalitis virus have the lowest number of imported cases. The incidence rate is generally high for the Palmerston region for all viruses. However, this could also be due it being a larger SA3 region when compared to the rest. Ross river Virus is one of the highly transmitted viruses locally within Australia. Following this is the Barmah Forest virus which shows a sudden increase in the year 2013. Dengue virus is the most highly imported virus. It is interesting to note that Dengue cases are high when imported but one of the least when locally acquired. After performing the statistical analysis, it can be concluded that though the explanatory variables show a significant relationship with the incidence rate, the same cannot be said for the donation rate. Both temperature and rainfall show a positive correlation with the incidence rate. However, humidity does not show any significant relationship with the incidence rate. All the 3 weather conditions do not have any strong association with the SA3 regions and they do not depict strong trends or seasonality. However, east coast subtropical climatic regions include New South Wales and Queensland. This entails greater temperatures and noticeable rainy seasons together with high humidity that is practically year-round (Climate in Australia, n.d.). The places located on the eastern shore areas, which therefore experience more extreme weather conditions, are the outliers in our weather linear model graphs.


The shiny app that was built along the way is a culmination of all the analysis and visualisations that were done. We ensured that the code was modularised using the concept of shiny modules. Apart from this, we also worked on creating maps from scratch using shapefiles and also using the leaflet package. We have made the app as interactive as possible by adding various user inputs. The maps and graphs also show interactivity when clicked or hovered over. As far as the styling of the app is concerned, we made use of CSS, HTML and in-built shiny themes to make the app  look aesthetic. We used GitHub extensively to collaborate with each other and also used it for version control. 

One hindrance that we faced during the development of this project was the size of the dataset. Since the dataset was very huge and we had to merge them with shape files that contained boundary information of the SA3 regions, the size of the data got huge impacting the processing of the app. Another limitation of the project would be the models and variables we considered during the statistical analysis. Due to time constraints, we were unable to extensively use the different variables provided to us and also take into account other variables that could significantly contribute to understanding the patterns in arbovirus transmission. We also wished to take into account the daily temperature data to identify unique trends in the data however, this could have led to the data becoming, even more, bigger which would lead to computational issues. 



### Conclusion

Arbovirus transmission is increasing day by day, due to the change in weather patterns and increased cross-border travel. Understanding the reason behind the transmission of such viruses is crucial in dealing with the repercussions of it. In this era, we need to use technology as an important tool in making stories out of the raw data we possess. So, we built a shiny app that could visually present facts and figures about arbovirus transmission in Australia. This added value to the findings that were obtained from the statistical analysis and other patterns that existed in the data. Adding to this, statistical modelling of the data has led to a better understanding of the relationships between the variables that surround arboviral transmission. This app can be used in other settings where studies about other viral transmissions are carried out or for other countries that seek to understand the spread of this virus in their country. This project has also helped us hone our skills in shiny app development, project management and active collaboration through [GitHub](https://github.com/pjai0005/Analysis-on-Arbovirus-Transmission). Overall, it has been a very enriching experience for us to have worked on a project like this.
